- Real-time monitoring and control of station and drone power status.  
- Automated deployment pipelines with GitHub Actions.  

## Technologies
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (front-end)  
- WebSocket (real-time updates)  
- Python, Flask (backend API development)  
- Docker (containerization)  
- AWS EC2 & VPC (cloud hosting and secure networking)  
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)  

## My Role
- Led requirements analysis, system design, and full-stack development.  
- Implemented WebSocket-based real-time updates for monitoring and control.
